Let's change some characters and backgrounds! First things first, we're going to go to fermi:
<<setnpc fermi>>
Wow, look at Fermi go! Next up, here are some inline character changes
Like the friendly {{setnpc knifecrab}} knifecrab.
Let's just go back to fermi for one{{setnpc fermi}} sec. 
And now, let's make fermi {{setnpc fermismirk}} smirk!
Anyway, time to remove the npc:
<<setnpc none>>
And back to fermi, being {{setnpc fermishock}}shocked.
<<setnpc fermi left>>
<<setspeaker none>>
Let's put fermi on the left
And make them shocked{{setnpc fermishock}} again.
And make them {{setnpc fermifear}}scared
Let's put the guppy on the screen{{setguppy}}
And put knifecrab instead of guppy{{setnpc knifecrab left}}
And on the right {{setnpc knifecrab right}} with guppy back on {{setguppy}}
That's all i have folks! ciao
