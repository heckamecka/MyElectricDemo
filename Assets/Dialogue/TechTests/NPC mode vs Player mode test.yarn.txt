This is a test of guppy vs npc mode. 
By default, we should start out in NPC mode and this text should be playing regardless of player input
We are now going to go to player mode, in which the text should only play while the player is hovering over a node. Go ahead and choose Jemison: {{sbopen jJemison1}}.
