This is a simple wait command test. First, let's wait for two seconds before the next line with "wait 2.0"
<<wait 2.0>>
Now, the same thing but with no decimal point; "wait 2"
<<wait 2>>
One-digit fraction, 0.5s:
<<wait 0.5>>
Longer wait, 5s
<<wait 5>>
Now, let's inline wait: 
1.0s, {{wait 1.0}}1.5s, {{wait 1.5}}2s, {{wait 2}}5s, {{wait 5}}, and wait 3.564314586s {{wait 3.564314586}}
Have a good one, everyone!
