That worked! However, the double brace jump doesn't work so well with our switchbreaker mechanic, so instead we are going to use the double curly-brace jump. 
Here's one to get started: {{jump 2}}

We've arrived! Now, time to test the interaction between an sbopen and a meh-flavored jump. 
We are going to provide you with a switchbreaker opening, and then a jump -- you should be able to choose the switchbreaker option now and skip the jump: {{jump JumpSequence}}

After choosing armstrong, you should see this text!

We are now going to loop back to the last juncture so you can try waiting for the jump, but the test sequence is now over.

You should see this text if you did not choose armstrong, and only yielded to the jump. 
We are now going to loop back to the last juncture so you can try using the switchbreaker before the jump, but the test sequence is now over.

Switchbreaker is opening, now! {{sbopen jDidNotJump cDidNotJump aDidNotJump}} The switchbreaker is now open. You can choose a character to skip over the jump, or just wait for this text to be over to let the jump happen. Three! Two! One! {{sbclose}}{{jump didJump}}
