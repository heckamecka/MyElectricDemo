This is a test of using text speeds with custom, per-character deltas.
This sentence contains only alpha characters and should go rather quickly
This, sentence, uses, plenty, of, commas, which should each come with a, small, pause
This sentence! uses. a collection? of! sentence terminators which! should? each. come! with! a larger pause
This      sentence        has     a bunch of unecessary   whitespace,   which should go       lickety-split
This sentence... uses a bunch???? of sentence terminators!!!!!!! in a row and is probably????? a pain in the ass to read
