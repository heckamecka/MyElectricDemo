This is a test of using commands to overwrite the speed of displayed text.
<<setspeed fast>>
This is the fast speed; The quick brown fox! jumps, over, the lazy dog. The quick brown fox! jumps, over, the lazy dog.
<<setspeed medium>>
This is the medium speed; The quick brown fox! jumps, over, the lazy dog. The quick brown fox! jumps, over, the lazy dog.
<<setspeed slow>>
This is the slow speed; The quick brown fox! jumps, over, the lazy dog.
Now we are going to change the text speed inline:
<<setspeed slow>>
This sentence starts slow, {{setspeed medium}} but now it's at medium speed. Cool. And now, {{setspeed fast}} let's get fast up in here! Fast fast fast.
fast fast fast, {{setspeed slow}} slow, slow, {{setspeed medium}} medium!! it's medium!! hell yeah but now {{setspeed fast}} we're fast again, fast fast fast fast fast fassssst
